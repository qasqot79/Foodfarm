            Foodfarm is a place where buyers can shop directly from the farmers, from the fields to the plate.
            It is aimed at ensuring sustainable farming, sustainable eating, and promoting fair trade for farmers.
            Our mission is to banish hunger in Nigeria by making food more easily accessible to the final consumers
            by reducing the middlemen interference.
